Data are five-year estimates. To derive estimates of net migration, the United Nations Population Division takes into account the past migration history of a country or area, the migration policy of a country, and the influx of refugees in recent periods. The data to calculate these official estimates come from a variety of sources, including border statistics, administrative records, surveys, and censuses. When no official estimates can be made because of insufficient data, net migration is derived through the balance equation, which is the difference between overall population growth and the natural increase during the 1990-2000 intercensal period.","sourceOrganization":"United Nations Population Division, World Population Prospects 2008.","topics":[{"id":"2","value":"Aid Effectiveness "},{"id":"7","value":"Financial Sector "}]},{"id":"SM.POP.TOTL","name":"International migrant stock, total","source":{"id":"2","value":"World Development Indicators"},"sourceNote":"International migrant stock is the number of people born in a country other than that in which they live.
